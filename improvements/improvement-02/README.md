# Improvement 02: Focused Implementation

## 🎯 Core Goal

Implement the **essential** project-centric architecture changes with **minimal risk** and **maximum speed**.

## ✅ What We're Building (3 Epics Only)

### Epic 1: Data Model Simplification

- Update `types.ts` with simplified interfaces
- Add UUIDs, remove complexity overhead
- **No breaking changes to existing data**

### Epic 2: UUID Generation & Index Management

- Replace ID generation with proper UUIDs
- Add index-based prioritization (1, 2, 3...)
- **Keep existing tools working**

### Epic 3: Basic Document Support

- Simple document creation and attachment
- Basic integration with onboarding
- **No versioning or advanced features**

## ❌ What We're NOT Doing (Save for Later)

- ❌ Parallelization analysis algorithms
- ❌ Complex dependency validation
- ❌ Advanced MCP protocol features
- ❌ Extensive tool refactoring
- ❌ Real-time notifications
- ❌ Document versioning
- ❌ Complex migration scripts

## 🚀 Success Criteria

**Must Have:**

- All entities use UUIDs
- Clear index-based ordering works
- Basic document attachment works
- Existing functionality still works
- Agents can onboard with document context

**Timeline:** 3 weeks maximum

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

- **Backward compatibility** - existing data still works
- **Incremental changes** - small, testable updates
- **Simple rollback** - changes are easily reversible
- **No breaking changes** - existing tools keep working

**Remember:** We can always add advanced features later once the core is solid. Focus on shipping the essentials first! 🎯
